Abstract: Electroencephalography, or EEG, is a widely used, affordable physiological measure to detect neural activity with excellent temporal specificity. Electrical potentials from several sites at the brain are measured over a period of time using electrodes applied to the scalp, and the results can be plotted over both space (location of the electrode) and time. While already challenging to analyze, this analysis is convoluted by external factors such as muscle movement (heart and eyes), electrical disturbance, and electrode drift (physical movement of electrodes on the scalp). Methods for processing EEG data including artifact removal are highly non-standardized and new procedures are constantly evolving. Expanding on an existing data cleaning pipeline using Artificial Neural Networks, we propose modifications that allow discrimination of artifacts across varying configurations of sensors and time intervals.
